The Application class provides for Screenweaver HX application wide operations.

	When no path is specified, SWHX will look for the plug-in (version 8 or 9) at /Library/Internet Plug-Ins on OS-X,
	and %PROGRAM_FILES%\Mozilla Firefox\plugins on Windows.
	A version argument can be passed to indicate that any pre-installed plug-ins found on the system should be by-passed in case they are of lower version than specified.

	</p>
	<p>
	In case the plug-in is not found in any of the forementioned locations, SWHX will download the plugin from one of the following URLs:

	http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/xpi/current/flashplayer-win.xpi
	http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/xpi/current/flashplayer-mac.xpi

	<p>
	Downloading can be disabled by specifying -D NO_SWHX_PLUGIN on compilation of the back-end.
