<p>This tutorial show how to use the Screenweaver HX Flash API to setup synchronous communications between a back-end developed with haXe and a front-end developed using the Flash 9 IDE. The same principles apply for developing a front-end using Flex 2.</p>
<p><b>Compilation</b></p>
<p>Build the application front-end using the Flash 9 IDE by loading ui.fla and pressing CTRL-ENTER.</p>
<p>For continued compilation of the back-end, open up terminal or the command prompt, navigate to the sample folder and issue:</p>
<p><i>haxe compile.hxml</i></p>
<p><b>Execution</b></p>
<p>To run the sample, issue:</p>
<p><i>neko app.n</i></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can launch with the Screenweaver HX boot loader, found in <i>&lt;$haxlib path swhx&gt;/tools</i>. Doing so requires all build materials to be in the same folder as the boot loader.</p>
