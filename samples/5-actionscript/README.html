<p>This tutorial show how to handle the FSCommand events from an ActionScript or haXe application. In this example we handle the "save_file" fscommand and use it to save some data on the local drive.</p>
<p><b>Compilation</b></p>
<p>To compile, open up terminal or the command prompt, navigate to the sample folder and issue:</p>
<p><i>haxe compile.hxml</i></p>
<p><b>Execution</b></p>
<p>To run the sample, issue:</p>
<p><i>neko app.n</i></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can launch with the Screenweaver HX boot loader, found in <i>&lt;$haxlib path swhx&gt;/tools</i>. Doing so requires all build materials to be in the same folder as the boot loader.</p>
<p><b>*NOTE*</b> - this sample expects MTASC to be installed to your system.</p>
